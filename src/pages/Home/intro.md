## Welcome to sortingview!

This web app allows you to interactively view and share results of electrophysiolic spike sorting.

The frontend (GUI) and backend (compute engine) are decoupled, allowing you to view your own data without uploading to our servers. You can also share those views with remote collaborators without uploading any data.
